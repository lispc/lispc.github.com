It is the first time that I really use a 3D-modeling software. I choose [Blender](http://www.blender.org) since it is an open-source sofware with full-featured python script support which is very useful for a programmmer like me, besides, it is as powerful as business softwares like 3DMAX.
I find [a video in youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y__uzGKmxt8) is a very good learing resource for newbies. I just followed the tutorial and below are my result.
